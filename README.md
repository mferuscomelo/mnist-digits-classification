# MNIST Digits Classification

## Description
Created as an Applied Deep Learning Trainee as part of the MIT FutureMakers program, a part-time 6-week AI learning program, developed through a collaboration between [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and the [MIT RAISE (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) Initiative](https://raise.mit.edu/). More information on my work during the program can be found here: [https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers](https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers)

Model accuracy: 99.27%

You can now draw your own numbers (as many digits as you want) and the model will identify them, all without having to leave the notebook.
